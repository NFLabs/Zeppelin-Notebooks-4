Individual dependent values denoted by Yj can be solved by modifying the equation a little: Yj\u003db0+∑(biXij)+ϵj\n\n* Logistic regression is another generalized linear model (GLM) procedure using the same basic formula, but instead of the continuous Y, it is regressing for the probability of a categorical outcome. In simplest form, this means that we\u0027re considering just one outcome variable and two states of that variable- either 0 or 1.\n\n\n[stackexchange]:http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/29325/what-is-the-difference-between-linear-regression-and-logistic-regression)\n[quora]:http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-relationship-between-linear-and-logistic-regression",
